Python is being employed because the team is already proficient with the language. For this task, it is capable of all data manipulation required, with any computational deficit not being significant enough to justify switching to a different language. In particular, the Pandas library is being used to handle data manipulation and analysis for this project. Furthermore, a future event list and entities list are made to handle and schedule events. The idleCheck() function is implemented to check and keep track of all active and idle entities. In the main loop, Inspector and workstation queues and entities are created. Scheduler is updated with two inspectors and three workstations
